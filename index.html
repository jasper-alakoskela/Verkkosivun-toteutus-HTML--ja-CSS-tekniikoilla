        <p>Suicideboys (stylized as $uicideboy$) is an American hip hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in 2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and Scrim (stylized as $crim).
             Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud, the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation.
              They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is distributed by Caroline Distribution.</p>
              <p>The duo are considered one of the most popular acts in the underground rap scene, and are also considered to have a cult following. After several years of solely releasing EPs and mixtapes, Suicideboys' debut studio album I Want to Die in New Orleans was released on September 7, 2018. It fared well commercially, becoming their first top-ten album on the US Billboard 200.
                In May 2019, they released their collaborative six-track EP with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker entitled Live Fast, Die Whenever. It also prominently featured Korn guitarist James Shaffer.</p>
